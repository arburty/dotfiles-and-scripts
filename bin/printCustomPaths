# This awk script prints custom PATH directories
# if the directories are not already a part of PATH
#
# currently used for '/home/vladislav/bin' and './'
#
# This was created due to these directories being
# appended to the PATH several times during session
# creation in TMUX. the zshrc uses this to set them
# only one time.

# example in zshrc:
# PATH="$PATH"$(echo $PATH | $HOME/bin/printCustomPaths)
